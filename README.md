# Joining the Nigerian Competitive Programming Community
A repository to automate users joining the Nigerian competitive programming community.
## The steps below outline the procedures to join the community.
1. You must have a codeforces account. If you do not have one already, you can create a codeforces account at [codeforces.com](https://codeforces.com/register).
2. After creating a codeforces account, the next step would be to set your location to Nigeria. You can do this at [codeforces_social_page](https://codeforces.com/settings/social). Note: This link will not work if you are not already logged in to codeforces.
3. When you are done completing the steps above, fill the following form [Nigerian_CP_Communitiy](https://forms.gle/46d1wJYUCeoXDvW57) form.
4. You can check if your details have been set correctly [here](https://osazuwaemmanuel.github.io/ncp_community/validate_details.html).
5. If your country was successfully set to Nigeria and your codeforces account is valid, a link to the Nigerian Cometitive Programming Community WhatsApp will be displayed to you.
6. If you have any issues at all, please raise an issue [here](https://github.com/OsazuwaEmmanuel/ncp_community/issues).
